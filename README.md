MinIO is an object storage server that implements the same public API as Amazon S3.
 It can also be seen as an open source, highly performant cloud alternative. 
 It has a maximum single file upload size of 5TB, which is about the same as what other cloud services are offering, and is also built to be enterprise-ready.
